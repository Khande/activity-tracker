Activity Tracker
================
This is proof-of-concept plugin for IntelliJ IDEs to track and record user activity.
Currently the main feature is recording user activity into csv files.
To use the plugin see "Activity tracker" widget in IDE statusbar.

Why?
====
The main idea is to mine recorded data for interesting user or project-specific insights,
e.g. time spent in each part of project or editing/browsing ratio.
If you happen to use the plugin and find interesting way to analyze data, get in touch on
